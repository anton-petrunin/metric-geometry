\section{On semicontinuity}

Recall that according to \ref{ex:GH-vol}, volume is semicontinuos on the space of Riemannian manifolds with respect to stable Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
Analogous statement for $n$-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a $n$-dimensional manifolds does not hold.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
 
\end{thm}

First let us show that for any $\alpha>0$, the $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is not semicontinuous in the space of all compact metric spaces.

Choose a decreasing sequence $\eps_n\to 0$.
Consider the space $\spc{C}$ of infinite binary sequences with distance between two sequences $\bm{a}=(a_0,a_1,\dots)$ and $\bm{b}=(b_0,b_1,\dots)$ defined by 
\[\dist{\bm{a}}{\bm{b}}{\spc{C}}=\eps_n,\]
where $n$ is the minimal index such that $a_n\ne b_n$.
Note that $\spc{C}$ is homeomorphic to the Cantor set and 
given $\alpha>0$,
the sequence $\eps_n$ can be chosen so that its $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is infinite.

Note that $\spc{C}$ is a Hausdorff limit of its subsets $\spc{C}_n$ formed by sequences that constantly zero starting from $n$-th element.
The sets $\spc{C}_n$ is finite in particular its $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure vanish for $\alpha>0$.
This example shows that for any $\alpha>0$, the $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is not semicontinuous in the space of all compact metric spaces.

An analogous example can be produced comapct length spaces.
To do this consider a metric binary rooted tree $\spc{T}$ in which edges connecting level $n-1$ to the level $n$ of length $\eps_{n-1}-\eps_n$.
Note that the completion $\bar{\spc{T}}$ of $\spc{T}$ has a subset (its crown) isometric to $\spc{C}$.
Note further that $\bar{\spc{T}}$ is a Hausdorff limit of its subsets $\spc{T}_n$ --- the subtrees up to level $n$.
Note that $\spc{T}_n$ is can be covered by a finite line segments, in particular it has finite $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and therefore vanishing $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff for any $\alpha>1$.
Since the limit $\bar{\spc{T}}$ contains $\spc{C}$, we can choose a sequence $\eps_n$ so that $\mu_\alpha\spc{C}$ is arbitrary large (or even infinite).
It shows that for any $\alpha>1$, the $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is not semicontinuous in the space of all compact length spaces.

This construction can be modified further to obtain an increasing sequence of metric tensors $g_n$ on a disc $\DD$ such that (1) $\vol(\DD,g_n)<1$ for each $n$, (2) the induced metrics $\dist{*}{*}{g_n}$ converge to a metric $\rho$ on $\DD$, and given any Cantor space $\spc{C}$ as described above (3) there is a bilipschitz map $\spc{C}\to(\DD,\rho)$.
Note that the last condition implies that $\mu_2(\DD,rho)$ can be made arbitrary large, or infinite.
Therefore for any $\alpha\ge 2$, the $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is not semicontinuous in the space of all compact length spaces homeomorphic to a manifold and equipped with stable convergence.

Now we want to extend nonsemicontinuity even further.
Note that the tree $\bar{\spc{T}}$ admits a length-preserving embedding to the Euclidean space; we may assume that all 



\section{Sub-Riemannian metrics}

Choose a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Note that the function $\alpha\mapsto \mu_\alpha(A)_\spc{X}$ is nondecreasing;
moreover there is a critical value $\alpha_0\in[0,\infty]$ such that $\mu_\alpha(A)_\spc{X}=0$ if $\alpha<\alpha_0$ and $\mu_\alpha(A)_\spc{X}=\infty$ if $\alpha>\alpha_0$.
This value is called \index{Hausdorff dimension}\emph{Hausdorff dimension} of $\spc{X}$, or briefly $\alpha_0=\dim_H\spc{X}$.

The following statement is classical, a proof can be found in .

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
The Hausdorff dimension of any metric space can not be smaller than its Lebesgue covering dimension.
In particular, if a metric space $\spc{X}$ is homeomorphic to an $n$-dimensional manifold, then $\dim_H\spc{X}\ge n$.
 
\end{thm}

Note that the construction described in the previous section can be used to produce a metric on manifold of dimension $n\ge 2$ with arbitrary Hausdorff dimension $\alpha\ge n$.

In this section we will discuss another interesting source of such examples.
