Let $F=\set{n\in \NN}{f(n)=n}$; we need to show that $\omega(F)=1$.

Consider an oriented graph $\Gamma$ with vertex set $\NN\backslash F$ such that $m$ is connected to $n$ if $f(m)=n$.
Show that each connected component of $\Gamma$ has at most one cycle.
Use it to subdivide vertices of $\Gamma$ into three sets $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ such that $f(S_i)\cap S_i=\emptyset$ for each $i$.

Conclude that $\omega(S_1)=\omega(S_2)=\omega(S_3)=0$ and hence \[\omega(F)=\omega(\NN\setminus(S_1\cup S_2\cup S_3))=1.\]

the key statement is due to Miroslav KatÄ›tov \cite{katetov}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:linear}.}
Choose a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\omega$ and set $L(\bm{s})=s_\omega$.
It remains to observe that $L$ is linear.

Use \ref{ex:ultrakatetov}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:lim(tree)}.}
Let $\gamma$ be a path from $p$ to $q$ in a metric tree $\spc{T}$.
Assume that $\gamma$ passes thru a point $x$ on distance $\ell$ from $[pq]$.
Then 
\[\length\gamma\ge \dist{p}{q}{}+2\cdot \ell.
\eqlbl{eq:+ell}\]

Suppose that $\spc{T}_n$ is a sequence of metric trees that $\omega$-converges to $\spc{T}_\omega$.
By \ref{obs:ultralimit-is-geodesic}, the space $\spc{T}_\omega$ is geodesic.

The uniqueness of geodesics follows from \ref{eq:+ell}.
Indeed, if for a geodesic $[p_\omega q_\omega]$ there is another geodesic $\gamma_\omega$ connecting its ends, then it has to pass thru a point $x_\omega\notin [p_\omega q_\omega]$.
Choose sequences $p_n,q_n,x_n\in\spc{T}_n$ such that $p_n\to p_\omega$, $q_n\to q_\omega$, and $x_n\to x_\omega$ as $n\to\omega$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
\dist{p_\omega}{q_\omega}{}&=\length\gamma\ge \lim_{n\to\omega}(\dist{p_n}{x_n}{}+\dist{q_n}{x_n}{})\ge
\\
&\ge \lim_{n\to\omega}(\dist{p_n}{q_n}{}+2\cdot\ell_n)=
\\
&=\dist{p_\omega}{q_\omega}{}+2\cdot\ell_\omega.
\end{align*}
Since $x_\omega\notin [p_\omega q_\omega]$, we have that $\ell_\omega>0$ --- a contradiction.

It remains to show that any geodesic triangle $\spc{T}_\omega$ is a tripod.
Consider the sequence of centers of tripods $m_n$ for given sequences of points $x_n,y_n,z_n\in \spc{T}_n$.
Observe that its ultralimit $m_\omega$ is the center of the tripod with ends at $x_\omega,y_\omega,z_\omega\in \spc{T}_\omega$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:ultracompact}.}
Construct $\bm{X}$ and distance-preserving embeddings $\spc{X}_n\hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ that satisfy \ref{propery:GH}.
Given $x_\infty\in \spc{X}_\infty$, choose a sequence $x_n\in \spc{X}_n$ such that $x_n\to x_\infty$ in $\bm{X}$.
Let $x_\omega$ be $\omega$-limit of the sequence $x_n$ in $\bm{X}$.
Note that $x_\omega\in \spc{X}_\infty$.
Show that the map $x_\infty\mapsto x_\omega$ is defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the sequence $x_n$.
Further, show that the map $x_\infty\mapsto x_\omega$ is an isometry of $\spc{X}_\infty$.
Make a conclusion.

\parbf{\ref{ex:ultrapower}.}
Further, we consider $\spc{X}$ as a subset of $\spc{X}^\omega$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:ultrapower:a}.} Follows directly from the definitions.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:ultrapower:compact}.}
Suppose $\spc{X}$ compact.
Given a sequence $x_1,x_2,\dots{}\in\spc{X}$, denote its $\omega$-limit in $\spc{X}^\omega$ by $x^\omega$ and its $\omega$-limit in $\spc{X}$ by $x_\omega$.

Observe that $x^\omega=\iota(x_\omega)$.
Therefore, $\iota$ is onto.

If $\spc{X}$ is not compact, we can choose a sequence $x_n$ such that $\dist{x_m}{x_n}{}>\eps$ for fixed $\eps>0$ and all $m\ne n$.
Observe that
\[\lim_{n\to\omega}\dist{x_n}{y}{\spc{X}}\ge \tfrac\eps2\]
for any $y\in\spc{X}$.
It follows that $x_\omega$ lies at the distance $\ge\tfrac\eps2$ from~$\spc{X}$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:ultrapower:proper}.}
A sequence of points $x_n$ in $\spc{X}$ will be called $\omega$-bounded if there is a real constant $C$ such that
\[\dist{p}{x_n}{\spc{X}}\le C\] 
for $\omega$-almost all $n$.

The same argument as in \ref{SHORT.ex:ultrapower:compact} shows that any $\omega$-bounded sequence has its $\omega$-limit in $\spc{X}$.
Further, if $(x_n)$ is not  $\omega$-bounded, then 
\[\lim_{n\to\omega}\dist{p}{x_n}{\spc{X}}=\infty;\]
that is, $x_\omega$ does not lie in the metric component of $p$ in $\spc{X}^\omega$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:isom-ultrapower}.}
Let us identify points in $\spc{X}$ with nonnegative integers.
Consider the set $\mathcal{A}$ of all sequences $a_n$ such that $a_0=0$ and $a_{n+1}=a_n+\eps_n\cdot 2^n$ where $\eps_n\in\{0,1\}$ for any $n$.
Observe that $\mathcal{A}$ has cardinality continuum and distinct sequences in $\mathcal{A}$ have distinct $\omega$-limits.
Conclude that the cardinality of $\spc{X}^\omega$ is at least continuum.

Show and use that the spaces $\spc{X}^\omega$ and $(\spc{X}^\omega)^\omega$ have discrete metrics and both have cardinality at most continuum.


\parbf{\ref{ex:ultrapower(ultrapower)}.}
Choose a bijection $\iota\:\NN\to \NN\times \NN$.
Given a set $S\subset \NN$, consider the sequence $S_1$, $S_2,\dots$ of subsets in $\NN$ defined by $m\in S_n$ if $(m,n)\z=\iota(k)$ for some $k\in S$.
Set $\omega'(S)=1$ if and only if $\omega(S_n)=1$ for $\omega$-almost all $n$.
It remains to check that $\omega'$ meets the conditions of the exercise.

\parit{Comment.}
It turns out that $\omega'\ne \omega$ for any $\iota$;
see the post of Andreas Blass \cite{blass}.

on the diagram. Observe that $\spc{T}$ is proper.

Consider the vertex $v_\omega=\lim_{n\to\omega}v_n$ in the ultrapower $\spc{T}^\omega$.
Observe that $\omega$ has an infinite degree.
Conclude that $\spc{T}^\omega$ is not locally compact.

Consider a product space $[0,1]\times[0,\tfrac12]\times[0,\tfrac14]\times\dots$

\parbf{\ref{ex:Asym(Lob)}}; \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):metric-tree}.
Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that sides of any geodesic triangle intersect a disk of radius $\delta$.
Conclude and use that any geodesic triangle in $\Asym\spc{L}$ is a tripod.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):homogeneous}.} Observe that $L$ is one-point-homogeneous and use it.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):continuum}.} 
By \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):homogeneous}, it is sufficient to show that $p_\omega$ has a continuum degree.

Choose distinct geodesics $\gamma_1,\gamma_2\:[0,\infty)\to L$ that start at a point $p$.
Show that the limits of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ run in the different connected components of $(\Asym\spc{L})\setminus \{p_\omega\}$.
Since there is a continuum of distinct geodesics starting at $p$,
we get that the degree of $p_\omega$ is at least continuum.

On the other hand, the set of sequences of points in $L$  has cardinality continuum.
In particular, the set of points in $\Asym\spc{L}$ has cardinality at most continuum.
It follows that the degree of any vertex is at most continuum.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):others}.}
The proof for the Lobachevsky space goes along the same lines.

{\sloppy

For the infinite three-regular tree, part \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):metric-tree} follows from \ref{ex:lim(tree)}.
The three-regular tree is not one-point-homogeneous, but it is vertex-homogeneous; the latter is sufficient to prove \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):homogeneous}.
No changes are needed in~\ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):continuum}.

}

\parit{Remark.}
Anna Dyubina and Iosif Polterovich \cite{dyubina-polterovich} proved that the properties \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):homogeneous} and \ref{SHORT.ex:Asym(Lob):continuum} describe the tree $\spc{T}$ up to isometry.
In particular, the asymptotic space of the Lobachevsky plane does not depend on the choice of the ultrafilter and the sequence $\lambda_n\to \infty$.
