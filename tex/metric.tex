\section{Metric spaces}
\label{sec:metric spaces}


The distance between two points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ will be denoted by $\dist{x}{y}{}$ or $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$.
The latter notation is used if we need to emphasize 
that the distance is taken in the space~${\spc{X}}$.

The function 
\[\distfun_x\:y\mapsto \dist{x}{y}{}\]
is called the \index{distance function}\emph{distance function} from~$x$. 

Given $R\in[0,\infty]$ and $x\in \spc{X}$, the sets
\begin{align*}
\oBall(x,R)&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{x}{y}{}<R\},
\\
\cBall[x,R]&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{x}{y}{}\le R\}
\end{align*}
are called, respectively, the  \index{open ball}\emph{open} and  the \index{closed ball}\emph{closed  balls}   of radius $R$ with center~$x$.
Again, if we need to emphasize that these balls are taken in the metric space $\spc{X}$,
we write 
\[\oBall(x,R)_{\spc{X}}\quad\text{and}\quad\cBall[x,R]_{\spc{X}}.\]


\section{Variations of definition}

Recall that a metric is a real-valued function $(x,y)\mapsto\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$ that satisfies the following conditions for any three points $x,y,z\in \spc{X}$:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}\ge 0$,
\item\label{metric=0} $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}= 0$ $\iff$ $x=y$,
\item $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}=\dist{y}{x}{\spc{X}}$,
\item $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}+\dist{y}{z}{\spc{X}}\ge\dist{x}{z}{\spc{X}}$,
\end{enumerate}

\parbf{Pseudometrics.}
A generalization of a metric in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero is called \emph{pseudometric}.
In other words, to define pseudometric, we need to remove condition (\ref{metric=0}) from the list.

The following two observations show that
nearly any question about pseudometric spaces can be reduced to a question about genuine metric spaces.

Assume $\spc{X}$ is a pseudometric space.
Set
$x\sim y$ if $\dist{x}{y}{}=0$. 
Note that if $x\sim x'$, then $\dist{y}{x}{}=\dist{y}{x'}{}$ for any $y\in\spc{X}$.
Thus, $\dist{*}{*}{}$ defines a metric on the
quotient set $\spc{X}/{\sim}$.
In this way we obtain a metric space $\spc{X}'$.
The space $\spc{X}'$ is called the 
\emph{corresponding metric space} for the pseudometric space $\spc{X}$.
Often we do not distinguish between $\spc{X}'$ and~$\spc{X}$. 

\parbf{$\bm{\infty}$-metrics.}
One may also consider metrics with values in $\RR\cup\{\infty\}$;
we might call them $\infty$-metrics or simply metrics.

Again nearly any question about $\infty$-metric spaces can be reduced to a question about genuine metric spaces. 

Indeed, set $x\approx y$ if and only if $\dist{x}{y}{}<\infty$;
this is an other equivalence relation on $\spc{X}$.
The equivalence class of a point $x\in\spc{X}$ will be called the \emph{metric component}\index{metric component} 
 of $x$; it will be denoted as $\spc{X}_x$.
One could think of $\spc{X}_x$ as  $\oBall(x,\infty)_{\spc{X}}$ --- the open ball centered at $x$ and radius $\infty$ in $\spc{X}$.

It follows that any $\infty$-metric space is a \emph{disjoint union} of genuine metric spaces --- the metric components of the original $\infty$-metric space.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Given two sets $A$ and $B$ on the plane, set 
\[\dist{A}{B}{}=\mu(A\backslash B)+\mu(B\backslash A),\]
where $\mu$ denotes the Lebesgue measure.
\begin{subthm}{}
Show that $\dist{*}{*}{}$ is a pseudometric on the set of bounded measurable sets of the plane.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
Show that $\dist{*}{*}{}$ is an $\infty$-metric on the set of all open sets of the plane.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\section{Completeness}

Recall that a metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \emph{complete} if every Cauchy sequence of points in $\spc{X}$ converges in $\spc{X}$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:almost-min}
Suppose that $\rho$ is a positive continuous function on a complete metric space $\spc{X}$.
Show that for any $\eps>0$ there is a point $x\in \spc{X}$ such that 
\[\rho(x)<(1+\eps)\cdot\rho(y)\]
for any point $y\in \oBall(x,\rho(x))$.
\end{thm}

Most of the time we will assume that a metric space is complete.
The following construction produces a complete metric space $\bar{\spc{X}}$ for any given metric space $\spc{X}$.
The space $\bar{\spc{X}}$ is called \emph{completion} of $\spc{X}$;
the original space $\spc{X}$ forms a dense subset in $\bar{\spc{X}}$.

\parbf{Completion.}
Given metric space $\spc{X}$, 
consider the set of all Cauchy sequences in $\spc{X}$.
Note that for any two Cauchy sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ the right hand side in \ref{eq:cauchy-dist} is defined; moreover it defines a pseudometric on the set $\spc{C}$ of all Cauchy sequences
\[\dist{(x_n)}{(y_n)}{\spc{C}}\df\lim_{n\to\infty}\dist{x_n}{y_n}{\spc{X}}.\eqlbl{eq:cauchy-dist}\]
The corresponding metric space is called a completion of $\spc{X}$.

It is left as an exercise that completion of $\spc{X}$ is complete.

Note that for each point $x\in\spc{X}$ one can consider a constant sequence $x_n=x$ which is Cauchy.
It defines a natural map $\spc{X}\to \bar{\spc{X}}$.
It is easy to check that this map is distance preserving.
In partucular we can (and will) consider $\spc{X}$ as a subset of $\bar{\spc{X}}$.

\section{Compactness}

Let us recall few equivalent definitions of compact metric spaces.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:compact}
A metric space $\spc{K}$ is compact if and only if one of the following equivalent condition holds:

\begin{subthm}{}
 Every open cover of $\spc{K}$ has a finite subcover.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
 For any open cover of $\spc{K}$ there is $\eps>0$ such that any $\eps$-ball in $\spc{K}$ lie in one element of the cover. (The value $\eps$ is called Lebesgue number of the covering.)
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
 Every sequence in $\spc{K}$ has a convergent subsequence.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{totally-bounded}
The space $\spc{K}$ is complete and \emph{totally bounded}; that is, for any $\eps>0$, the space $\spc{K}$ admits a finite cover by open $\eps$-balls.\footnote{Equivalently, for any $\eps>0$ there is a finite \emph{$\eps$-net}; that is a finite set of points $x_1,\dots,x_n\in \spc{K}$ such that any other point $x$ lies on the distance less than $\eps$ from one of $x_i$.}
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

Let $\pack_\eps\spc{X}$ be exact upper bound on the number of points $x_1,\z\dots,x_n\in \spc{X}$ such that $\dist{x_i}{x_j}{}\ge\eps$ for any $i\ne j$.

If $n=\pack_\eps\spc{X}<\infty$, then
the collection of points $x_1,\dots,x_n$ is called a \emph{maximal $\eps$-packing}.
Note that $n$ is the maximal number of open disjoint $\tfrac\eps2$-balls in $\spc{X}$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:pack-net}
Show that a complete space $\spc{X}$ is compact if and only of $\pack_\eps\spc{X}\z<\infty$ for any $\eps>0$.

Show that any maximal $\eps$-packing is an $\eps$-net.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:non-contracting-map}
Let $\spc{K}$  be a compact metric space and
\[f\:\spc{K}\z\to \spc{K}\] 
be a distance non-decreasing map.
Prove that $f$ is an isometry.
\end{thm}


A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \index{proper space}\emph{proper} if all closed bounded sets in $\spc{X}$ are compact. 
This condition is equivalent to each of the following statements:
\begin{itemize}
\item For some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$ and any $R<\infty$, 
the closed ball $\cBall[p,R]_{\spc{X}}$ is compact. 
\item The function $\distfun_p\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is proper for some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$;
that is, for any compact set $K\subset \RR$, its inverse image 
\[\distfun_p^{-1}(K)=\set{x\in \spc{X}}{\dist{p}{x}{\spc{X}}\in K}\]
is compact.
\end{itemize}

A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \emph{locally compact} if any point in $\spc{X}$ admits a compact neighborhood;
in other words, for any point $x\in\spc{X}$ a closed ball $\cBall[x,r]$ is compact for some $r>0$.

\section{Geodesics}
\label{sec:geods}

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $\II$\index{$\II$} a real interval. 
A~globally isometric map $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is called a \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesic}%
\footnote{Various authors call it differently: {}\emph{shortest path}, {}\emph{minimizing geodesic}.}; 
in other words, $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a geodesic if 
\[\dist{\gamma(s)}{\gamma(t)}{\spc{X}}=|s-t|\]
for any pair $s,t\in \II$.

We say that  $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a geodesic from point $p$ to point $q$ if 
$\II=[a,b]$ and $p=\gamma(a)$, $q=\gamma(b)$.
In this case the image of $\gamma$ is denoted by $[p q]$\index{$[{*}{*}]$} and with an abuse of notations  we also call it a \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesic}.
Given a geodesic $[pq]$, we can parametrize it by distance to $p$;
this parametrization will be denoted by $\geod_{[p q]}(t)$.


We may write $[p q]_{\spc{X}}$ 
to emphasize that the geodesic $[p q]$ is in the space  ${\spc{X}}$.
We also use the following shortcut notation:
\begin{align*}
\left] p q \right[&=[pq]\backslash\{p,q\},
&
\left] p q \right]&=[pq]\backslash\{p\},
&
\left[ p q \right[&=[pq]\backslash\{q\}.
\end{align*}

In general, a geodesic from $p$ to $q$ need not exist and if it exists, it need not  be unique.  
However, once we write $[p q]$ we assume mean that we have made a choice of geodesic.

A metric space is called \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesic} if any pair of its points can be joined by a geodesic. 


A \index{geodesic path}\emph{geodesic path} is a geodesic with constant-speed parametrization by $[0,1]$.
Given a geodesic $[p q]$,
we denote by $\geodpath_{[pq]}$ the corresponding geodesic path;
that is,
$$\geodpath_{[pq]}(t)\z\df\geod_{[pq]}(t\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{q}{}).$$

A curve $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$  is called a \index{geodesic!local geodesic}\emph{local geodesic} if for any $t\in\II$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $t$ in $\II$ such that the restriction $\gamma|_U$ is a  geodesic.
A constant-speed parametrization of a local geodesic by the unit interval $[0,1]$ is called a \index{geodesic!local geodesic}\emph{local geodesic path}. 



\section{Length}

A \emph{curve} is defined as a continuous map from a real interval to a space.
If the real interval is $[0,1]$, then the curve is called a \emph{path}.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and
$\alpha\: \II\to \spc{X}$ be a curve.
We define the \index{length}\emph{length} of $\alpha$ as 
\[
\length \alpha \df \sup_{t_0\le t_1\le\ldots\le t_n}\sum_i \dist{\alpha(t_i)}{\alpha(t_{i-1})}{}.
\]

A curve $\alpha$ is called \emph{rectifiable} if $\length \alpha<\infty$.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:length-semicont}
Length is a lower semi-continuous with respect to pointwise convergence of curves. 

More precisely, assume that a sequence
of curves $\gamma_n\:\II\to \spc{X}$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ converges pointwise 
to a curve $\gamma_\infty\:\II\to \spc{X}$;
that is, for any fixed $t \in \II$, $\gamma_n(t)\z\to\gamma_\infty(t)$ as $n\to\infty$. 
Then 
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \length\gamma_n \ge \length\gamma_\infty.\eqlbl{eq:semicont-length}$$
\end{thm}


\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-10}
\end{wrapfigure}


Note that the inequality \ref{eq:semicont-length} might be strict.
For example the diagonal $\gamma_\infty$ of the unit square 
can be  approximated by a stairs-like
polygonal curves $\gamma_n$
with sides parallel to the sides of the square ($\gamma_6$ is on the picture).
In this case
\[\length\gamma_\infty=\sqrt{2}\quad
\text{and}\quad \length\gamma_n=2\]
for any $n$.

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a sequence $t_0<t_1<\dots<t_k$ in $\II$.
Set 
\begin{align*}\Sigma_n
&\df
|\gamma_n(t_0)-\gamma_n(t_1)|+\dots+|\gamma_n(t_{k-1})-\gamma_n(t_k)|.
\\
\Sigma_\infty
&\df
|\gamma_\infty(t_0)-\gamma_\infty(t_1)|+\dots+|\gamma_\infty(t_{k-1})-\gamma_\infty(t_k)|.
\end{align*}

Note that for each $i$ we have 
\[|\gamma_n(t_{i-1})-\gamma_n(t_i)|\to|\gamma_\infty(t_{i-1})-\gamma_\infty(t_i)|\]
and therefore
\[\Sigma_n\to \Sigma_\infty\] 
as $n\to\infty$.
Note that 
\[\Sigma_n\le\length\gamma_n\]
for each $n$.
Hence
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \length\gamma_n \ge \Sigma_\infty.\eqlbl{>=Sigma-infty}$$

If $\gamma_\infty$ is rectifiable, we can assume that 
\begin{align*}
\length\gamma_\infty<\Sigma_\infty+\eps.
\end{align*}
for any given $\eps>0$.
By \ref{>=Sigma-infty} it follows that 
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \length\gamma_n > \length\gamma_\infty-\eps$$
for any $\eps>0$; whence \ref{eq:semicont-length} follows.

It remains to consider the case when $\gamma_\infty$ is not rectifiable; 
that is, $\length\gamma_\infty=\infty$.
In this case we can choose a partition so that $\Sigma_\infty>L$ for any real number $L$.
By \ref{>=Sigma-infty} it follows that 
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \length\gamma_n > L$$
for any given $L$; whence 
\[\liminf_{n\to\infty}\length\gamma_n=\infty\]
and \ref{eq:semicont-length} follows.
\qeds

\section{Length spaces}\label{sec:intrinsic}

If for any $\eps>0$ and any pair of points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$, there is a path $\alpha$ connecting $x$ to $y$ such that
\[\length\alpha< \dist{x}{y}{}+\eps,\]
then $\spc{X}$ is called a \index{length space}\emph{length space} and the metric on $\spc{X}$ is called a \index{length metric}\emph{length metric}.\label{page:length metric}

Note that any geodesic space is a length space.
As can be seen from the following example, the converse does not hold.


\begin{thm}{Example}
Let $\spc{X}$ be obtained by gluing a countable collection of disjoint intervals $\{\II_n\}$ of length $1+\tfrac1n$, where for each $\II_n$ the left end is glued to $p$ and the right end to~$q$.

Observe that the space $\spc{X}$ carries a natural complete length metric with respect to which $\dist{p}{q}{}=1$ but there is no geodesic connecting $p$ to~$q$.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:no-geod}
Give an example of a complete length space for which no pair of distinct points can be joined by a geodesic.
\end{thm}

Directly from the definition, it follows that if a path $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ connects two points $x$ and $y$ 
(that is, if $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$), then 
\[\length\alpha\ge \dist{x}{y}{}.\]
Set 
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\inf\{\length\alpha\}\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken for all paths connecing $x$ and $y$.
It is straightforward to check that $(x,y)\mapsto \yetdist{x}{y}{}$ is an $\infty$-metric; moreover $(\spc{X},\yetdist{*}{*}{})$ is a length space.
The metric $\yetdist{*}{*}{}$ is called \emph{induced length metric}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact=>complete}
Suppose $(\spc{X},\dist{*}{*}{})$ is a complete metric space.
Show that $(\spc{X},\yetdist{*}{*}{})$ is complete.
\end{thm}


Let $A$ be a subset of a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Given two points $x,y\in A$,
consider the value
\[\dist{x}{y}{A}=\inf_{\alpha}\{\length\alpha\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in $A$.%
\footnote{This notation slightly conflicts with the previously defined notation for distance $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$. However, most of the time we will work with ambient length spaces where the meaning will be unambiguous.}

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $x,y\in\spc{X}$.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called a \index{midpoint}\emph{midpoint} between $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{}=\dist{y}{z}{}=\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}.\]
\item Assume $\eps\ge 0$.
A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called an \index{$\eps$-midpoint}\emph{$\eps$-midpoint} between $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{},\quad\dist{y}{z}{}\le\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}+\eps.\]
\end{enumerate}


Note that a $0$-midpoint is the same as a midpoint.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:mid>geod}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space.
\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>length}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$  
 and any $\eps>0$
there is an $\eps$-midpoint~$z$.
Then $\spc{X}$ is a length space.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>geod:geod}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$, 
there is a midpoint~$z$.
Then $\spc{X}$ is a geodesic space.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We first prove (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>length}).
Let $x,y\in \spc{X}$ be a pair of points.

Set $\eps_n=\frac\eps{4^n}$, $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$.

Let $\alpha(\tfrac12)$ be an $\eps_1$-midpoint between $\alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(1)$.
Further, let $\alpha(\frac14)$ 
and $\alpha(\frac34)$ be $\eps_2$-midpoints between the pairs $(\alpha(0),\alpha(\tfrac12))$ 
and $(\alpha(\tfrac12),\alpha(1))$ respectively.
Applying the above procedure recursively,
on the $n$-th step we define $\alpha(\tfrac{k}{2^n})$,
for every odd integer $k$ such that $0<\tfrac k{2^n}<1$, 
as an $\eps_{n}$-midpoint between the already defined
$\alpha(\tfrac{k-1}{2^n})$ and $\alpha(\tfrac{k+1}{2^n})$.


In this way we define $\alpha(t)$ for $t\in W$,
where $W$ denotes the set of dyadic rationals in $[0,1]$.
Since $\spc{X}$ is complete, the map $\alpha$ can be extended continuously to $[0,1]$.
Moreover,
\[\begin{aligned}
\length\alpha&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{n-1}\cdot\eps_n\le
\\
&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\tfrac\eps2.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:eps-midpoint}
\]
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>length}).

To prove (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>geod:geod}), 
one should repeat the same argument 
taking midpoints instead of $\eps_n$-midpoints.
In this case \ref{eq:eps-midpoint} holds for $\eps_n=\eps=0$.
\qeds

Since in a compact space a sequence of $\tfrac1n$-midpoints $z_n$ contains a convergent subsequence, Lemma~\ref{lem:mid>geod} immediately implies

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:length+proper=>geodesic}
A proper length space is geodesic.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Hopf--Rinow theorem}\label{thm:Hopf-Rinow}
Any complete, locally compact length space is proper.
\end{thm}

It is instructive to solve the following exercise before reading the proof.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Give an example of space which is locally compact but not proper.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a locally compact length space.
Given $x\in \spc{X}$, denote by $\rho(x)$ the supremum of all $R>0$ such that
the closed ball $\cBall[x,R]$ is compact.
Since $\spc{X}$ is locally compact, 
$$\rho(x)>0
\quad\text{for any}\quad
x\in \spc{X}.\eqlbl{eq:rho>0}$$
It is sufficient to show that $\rho(x)=\infty$ for some (and therefore any) point $x\in \spc{X}$.

Assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)<\infty$. We claim that

\begin{clm}{} $B=\cBall[x,\rho(x)]$ is compact for any~$x$.
\end{clm}

Indeed, $\spc{X}$ is a length space;
therefore for any $\eps>0$, 
the set $\cBall[x,\rho(x)-\eps]$ is a compact $\eps$-net in~$B$.
Since $B$ is closed and hence complete, it must be compact.
\claimqeds
Next we claim that
\begin{clm}{} $|\rho(x)-\rho(y)|\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$ for any $x,y\in \spc{X}$;
in particular $\rho\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is a continuous function.
\end{clm}

Indeed, 
assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)+|x-y|<\rho(y)$ for some $x,y\in \spc{X}$. 
Then 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$ is a closed subset of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ for some $\eps>0$.
Then  compactness of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ implies compactness of $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$, a contradiction.\claimqeds

Set $\eps=\min\set{\rho(y)}{y\in B}$; the minimum is defined since $B$ is compact.
From \ref{eq:rho>0}, we have $\eps>0$.

Choose a finite $\tfrac\eps{10}$-net $\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}$ in $B$.
The union $W$ of the closed balls $\cBall[a_i,\eps]$ is compact.
Clearly 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]\subset W$.
Therefore $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]$ is compact,
a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{exercise from BH}
Construct a geodesic space that is locally compact,
but whose completion is neither geodesic nor locally compact.
\end{thm}

\section{Subsets in normed spaces}

Recall that a function $v\mapsto |v|$ on a vector space $\spc{V}$ is called \emph{norm} if it satisfies the following condition for any two vectors $v,w\in \spc{V}$ and a scalar $\alpha$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $|v|\ge 0$;
\item $|\alpha\cdot v|=|\alpha|\cdot |v|$;
\item $|v|+|w|\ge|v+w|$.
\end{itemize}

It is straightforward to check that for any normed space the function $(v,w)\mapsto |v-w|$ defines a metric on it.
Therefore any normed space is an example of metric space (which is in fact geodesic).
The following lemma says in particular that any metric space is isometric to a subset of a normed space.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:frechet}
Suppose $\spc{X}$ is a bounded separable space;
that is, $\diam\spc{X}$ is finite and $\spc{X}$ contains a countable, dense set $\{w_n\}$.
Given $x\in \spc{X}$, set $a_n(x)=\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}$.
Then 
\[\iota\:x\mapsto (a_1(x), a_2(x),\dots)\]
defines a distance preserving embedding $\iota\:\spc{X}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By the triangle inequality 
\[|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}.\]
Therefore $\iota$ is short.

Again by triangle inequality we have 
\[|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}-2\cdot\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}.\]
Since the set $\{w_n\}$ is dense, we can choose $w_n$ arbitrary close to $x$.
Whence the value $|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|$ can be chosen arbitrary close to $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$.
In other words 
\[\sup_n\{\,|\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}-\dist{w_n}{y}{\spc{X}}|\,\}\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}};\]
hence $\iota$ is distance non-decreasing.
\qeds

The following exercise generalizes the lemma to arbitrary separable spaces.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\{w_n\}$ is a countable, dense set in a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Choose $x_0\in \spc{X}$;
given $x\in \spc{X}$, set 
\[a_n(x)=\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}-\dist{w_n}{x_0}{\spc{X}}.\]
Show that $\iota\:x\mapsto (a_1(x), a_2(x),\dots)$ defines a distance preserving embedding $\iota\:\spc{X}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact-length}
Show that any compact metric space is isometric to a subspace of a compact geodesic space. 
\end{thm}

The lemma above was proved by Maurice René Fréchet in the paper where he defined metric space \cite{frechet}.
Nearly identical construction was rediscovered later by Kazimierz Kuratowski~\cite{kuratowski}.
Namely he made the following claim:

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:kuratowski}
Let $\spc{X}$ be arbitrary metric space.
Denote by $\ell^\infty(\spc{X})$ the space of all bounded functions of $\spc{X}$ equipped with sup-norm.

Then for any point $x_0\in \spc{X}$, the map $\iota\:\spc{X}\to \ell^\infty(\spc{X})$ defied by 
\[\iota\:x\mapsto (\distfun_x-\distfun_{x_0})\]
is distance preserving.
\end{thm}

Note that this claim implies that \emph{any metric space is isometric to a subset of a normed vector space}.
