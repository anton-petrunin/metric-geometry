\chapter{Universal spaces}

This lecture is based on the discussion of Urysohn space given in the book of Mikhael Gromov \cite{gromov-2007}.

\section{Embedding in a normed space}

Recall that a function $v\mapsto |v|$ on a vector space $\spc{V}$ is called \index{norm}\emph{norm} if it satisfies the following condition for any two vectors $v,w\in \spc{V}$ and a scalar $\alpha$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $|v|\ge 0$;
\item $|\alpha\cdot v|=|\alpha|\cdot |v|$;
\item $|v|+|w|\ge|v+w|$.
\end{itemize}

As an example, consider the space of real sequences equipped with \index{sup norm}\emph{sup norm} denoted by the $\ell^\infty$; that is, given a sequence $\bm{a}=a_1,a_2,\dots$, we define its $\ell^\infty$-norm as
\[|\bm{a}|_{\ell^\infty}=\sup_n\{\,|a_n|\,\}.\]


It is straightforward to check that for any normed space the function $(v,w)\mapsto |v-w|$ defines a metric on it.
Therefore any normed space is an example of metric space (in fact it is a geodesic space).
Often we do not distinguish between normed space and the corresponding metric space.

The following lemma says in particular that any compact metric space is isometric to a subset of a fixed normed space.

Recall that 
\index{diameter}\emph{diameter} of a metric space $\spc{X}$ (briefly $\diam \spc{X}$) is defined as least upper bound on the distances between pairs of its points;
that is,
\[\diam \spc{X}=\sup\set{\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}}{x,y\in \spc{X}}.\]



\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:frechet}
Suppose $\spc{X}$ is a \index{bounded space}\emph{bounded} \index{separable space}\emph{separable} metric space;
that is, $\diam\spc{X}$ is finite and $\spc{X}$ contains a countable, dense set $\{w_n\}$.
Given $x\in \spc{X}$, set $a_n(x)=\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}$.
Then 
\[\iota\:x\mapsto (a_1(x), a_2(x),\dots)\]
defines a distance-preserving embedding $\iota\:\spc{X}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
By the triangle inequality 
\[|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}.\eqlbl{eq:a-a=<dist}\]
Therefore $\iota$ is \index{short map}\emph{short} (in other words, $\iota$ is distance non-increasing).

Again by triangle inequality we have 
\[|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}-2\cdot\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}.\]
Since the set $\{w_n\}$ is dense, we can choose $w_n$ arbitrary close to $x$.
Whence the value $|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|$ can be chosen arbitrary close to $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$.
In other words 
\[\sup_n\{\,\left|\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}-\dist{w_n}{y}{\spc{X}}\right|\,\}\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}.\]
Whence 
\[\sup_n\{\,|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|\,\}\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}};\eqlbl{eq:a-a>=dist}\]
that is, $\iota$ is distance non-contracting.

Finally observe that \ref{eq:a-a=<dist} and \ref{eq:a-a>=dist} implies the lemma.
\qeds

The following exercise generalizes the lemma to arbitrary separable spaces.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:frechet}
Suppose $\{w_n\}$ is a countable, dense set in a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Choose $x_0\in \spc{X}$;
given $x\in \spc{X}$, set 
\[a_n(x)=\dist{w_n}{x}{\spc{X}}-\dist{w_n}{x_0}{\spc{X}}.\]
Show that $\iota\:x\mapsto (a_1(x), a_2(x),\dots)$ defines a distance-preserving embedding $\iota\:\spc{X}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact-length}
Show that any compact metric space $\spc{K}$ is isometric to a subspace of a compact geodesic space. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:kuratowski}
Let $\spc{X}$ be arbitrary metric space.
Denote by $\ell^\infty(\spc{X})$ the space of all bounded functions on $\spc{X}$ equipped with sup-norm.

Then for any point $x_0\in \spc{X}$, the map $\iota\:\spc{X}\to \ell^\infty(\spc{X})$ defied by 
\[\iota\:x\mapsto (\distfun_x-\distfun_{x_0})\]
is distance-preserving.
\end{thm}

Note that this claim implies that {}\emph{any metric space is isometric to a subset of a normed vector space}.

\section{Extension property}

Suppose a metric space $\spc{X}$ is a subspace of a pseudometric space $\spc{X}'$.
In this case we may say that $\spc{X}'$ is an \index{extension}\emph{extension} of $\spc{X}$.
If $\diam\spc{X}'\le d$, then we say that $\spc{X}'$ is a {}\emph{$d$-extension}.

If the complement $\spc{X}'\backslash \spc{X}$ contains a single point, say $p$, we say that $\spc{X}'$ is a \index{one-point extension}\emph{one-point extension} of $\spc{X}$.
In this case, to define metric on $\spc{X}'$, it is sufficient to specify the distance function from $p$; that is, a function $f\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ defined by 
\[f(x)=\dist{p}{x}{\spc{X}'}.\]

The function $f$ cannot be taken arbitrary --- the triangle inequality implies that 
\[f(x)+f(y)\ge \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}\ge |f(x)-f(y)|\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{X}$.
In particular $f$ is a non-negative 1-Lipschitz function on $\spc{X}$.
For a $d$-extension we need to assume in addition that $\diam\spc{X}\z\le d$ and $f(x)\le d$ for any $x\in \spc{X}$.

Any function $f$ of that type will be called \index{extension function}\emph{extension function}\label{page:extension function} or {}\emph{$d$-extension function} respectively.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:finite+1}
A metric space $\spc{U}$ meets  \index{extension property}\emph{extension property}  if for any finite subspace $\spc{F}\subset\spc{U}$ and any extension function $f\:\spc{F}\to\RR$ there is a point $p\in \spc{U}$ such that $\dist{p}{x}{}=f(x)$ for any $x\in \spc{F}$.

If we assume in addition that $\diam \spc{U}\le d$ and instead of extension functions we consider only $d$-extension functions, then we arrive to a definition of {}\emph{$d$-extension property}.

If in addition $\spc{U}$ is separable and complete, then it is called \index{Urysohn space}\emph{Urysohn space} or {}\emph{$d$-Urysohn space} respectively.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:univeral-separable}
There is a separable metric space with ($d$-) extension property (for any $d\ge 0$).
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a compact metric space such that $\diam\spc{X}\le d$.
Denote by $\spc{X}^d$ the space of all $d$-extension functions on $\spc{X}$ equipped with the metric defined by the sup-norm.
Note that the map $\spc{X} \to \spc{X}^d$ defined by $x\mapsto\distfun_x$ is a distance-preserving embedding,
so we can (and will) treat $\spc{X}$ as a subspace of $\spc{X}^d$, or, equivalently, $\spc{X}^d$ is an extension of $\spc{X}$.

Let us iterate this construction.
Start with a one-point space $\spc{X}_0$ and consider a sequence of spaces $(\spc{X}_n)$ defined by $\spc{X}_{n+1}\z=\spc{X}_n^d$.
Note that the sequence is nested, that is $\spc{X}_0\subset \spc{X}_1\subset\dots$
and the union
\[\spc{X}_\infty=\bigcup_n\spc{X}_n;\]
comes with metric such that
$\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_\infty} = \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_n}$
if $x,y\in\spc{X}_n$.

Note that if $\spc{X}$ is compact, then so is $\spc{X}^d$.
It follows that each space $\spc{X}_n$ is compact.
In particular $\spc{X}_\infty$ is a countable union of compact spaces;
therefore $\spc{X}_\infty$ is separable.

Any finite subspace $\spc{F}$ of $\spc{X}_\infty$ lies in some $\spc{X}_n$ for $n<\infty$.
By construction, there is a point $p\in \spc{X}_{n+1}$ that meets the condition in Definition~\ref{def:finite+1}.
That is, $\spc{X}_\infty$ has $d$-extension property.

A construction of a separable metric space with extension property is done along the same lines, but the sequence should be defined by $\spc{X}_{n+1}\z=\spc{X}_n^{d_n}$ for an increasing sequence $d_n\to\infty$;
also the point $p$ should be taken from $\spc{X}_{n+k}$ for sufficiently large $k$.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:completion-univeral}
If a metric space $\spc{V}$ meets the ($d$-) extension property, then so does its completion.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
We assume that $\spc{V}$ meets the extension property,
the case of $d$-extension property can be proved along the same lines.

Denote by $\spc{U}$ the completion of $\spc{V}$.
Note that $\spc{V}$ is a dense subset in a complete space $\spc{U}$.

Observe that $\spc{U}$ has {}\emph{approximate extension property};
that is, if $\spc{F}\z\subset\spc{U}$ is a finite set, $\eps>0$, and $f\:\spc{F}\to \RR$ is a extension function, then
there exists $p\in \spc{U}$ such that
\[\dist{p}{x}{}\lg f(x)\pm\eps.\]
for any $x\in\spc{F}$.

Therefore there is a sequence of points $p_n\in \spc{U}$ such that for any $x\in \spc{F}$, 
\[\dist{p_n}{x}{}\lg f(x)\pm\tfrac1{2^n}.\]

Moreover, we can assume that 
\[\dist{p_n}{p_{n+1}}{} < \tfrac1{2^n}\eqlbl{eq:|pn-pn|}\]
for all large $n$.
Indeed, consider the sets $\spc{F}_n=\spc{F}\cup\{p_n\}$ and the functions $f_n\:\spc{F}_n\to\RR$ defined by $f_n(x)=f(x)$ for any $x\in \spc{F}$, and
\[f_n(p_n)=\max\set{\bigl|\dist{p_n}{x}{}- f(x)\bigr|}{x\in \spc{F}}.\]
Observe that $f_n$ is a an extension function for large $n$ and
$f_n(p_n)\z<\tfrac1{2^n}$.
Therefore applying approximate extension property recursively we get~\ref{eq:|pn-pn|}.

By \ref{eq:|pn-pn|}, $(p_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence and its limit meets the condition in the definition of extension property (\ref{def:finite+1}).
\qeds

Note that \ref{prop:univeral-separable} and \ref{prop:completion-univeral} imply the following:

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:urysohn-exists}
Urysohn space, and $d$-Urysohn space for any $d>0$, exist.
\end{thm}

\section{Universality}

A metric space will be called \emph{universal} if it includes as a subspace an isometric copy of any separable metric space.
In \ref{ex:frechet}, we proved that $\ell^\infty$ is a universal space. 
The following proposition shows that an Urysohn space is universal as well.
Unlike $\ell^\infty$, Urysohn spaces are separable;
so it might be considered as a \emph{better} universal space.
Theorem \ref{thm:compact-homogeneous} will give another reason why Urysohn spaces are better.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:sep-in-urys}
An Urysohn space is universal.
That is, if $\spc{U}$ is an Urysohn space, then any separable metric space $\spc{S}$ admits a distance-preserving embedding $\spc{S}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$.

Moreover, for any finite subspace $\spc{F}\subset \spc{S}$,
any distance-preserving embedding $\spc{F}\hookrightarrow \spc{U}$ can be extended to a distance preserving embedding $\spc{S}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$.

An $d$-Urysohn space is $d$-universal;
that is, the above statements hold provided $\diam\spc{S}\le d$.  
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We will prove the second statement,
the first statement is its partial case for $\spc{F}=\emptyset$.

The required isometry will be denoted by $x\mapsto x'$.

Choose a dense sequence of points $s_1,s_2,\dotsc\in\spc{S}$.
We may assume that $\spc{F}=\{s_1,\dots,s_n\}$, so $s_i'\in \spc{U}$ are defined for $i\le n$.

The sequence $s_i'$ for $i>n$ can be defined recursively using the extension property in $\spc{U}$.
Namely suppose that $s_1',\dots,s_{i-1}'$ are already defined.
Since $\spc{U}$ is universal, there is a point $s_i'\in \spc{U}$ such that
\[\dist{s_i'}{s_j'}{\spc{U}}=\dist{s_i}{s_j}{\spc{S}}\]
for any $j<i$.

We constructed a distance-preserving map $s_i\mapsto s_i'$, it remains to extend it to a continuous map on whole $\spc{S}$.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:geodesics-urysohn}
Show that any two distinct points in an Urysohn space can be jointed by infinite number of geodesics.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact-extension}
Modify the proofs of \ref{prop:completion-univeral} and \ref{prop:sep-in-urys} to prove the following theorem.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:compact-extension}
Let $K$ be a compact set in a separable space $\spc{S}$.
Then any distance-preserving map from $K$ to an Urysohn space can be extended to 
a distance-preserving map on whole $\spc{S}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sc-urysohn}
Show that ($d$-) Urysohn space is simply connected.
\end{thm}

\section{Uniqueness and homogeneity}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:urysohn-unique}
Suppose $\spc{F}\subset \spc{U}$ and $\spc{F}'\subset \spc{U}'$ be finite isometric subspaces in a pair of ($d$-)Urysohn spaces $\spc{U}$ and $\spc{U}'$.
Then any isometry $\iota\spc{F}\to \spc{F}'$ can be extended to an isometry $\spc{U}\to \spc{U}'$.

In particular ($d$-)Urysohn space is unique up to isometry.
\end{thm}

Note that \ref{prop:sep-in-urys} implies that there are distance-preserving maps $\spc{U}\to \spc{U}'$ and $\spc{U}'\to \spc{U}$,
but it does not solely imply existence of an isometry.
The following construction use the same idea as in the proof of \ref{prop:sep-in-urys}, but we need to apply it {}\emph{back-and-forth} to ensure that the constructed distance-preserving map is onto.

\parit{Proof.}
Choose dense sequences $a_1,a_2,\dots\in \spc{U}$ and $b'_1,b'_2,\dots\in \spc{U}'$.
We can assume that $\spc{F}=\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$, $\spc{F}'=\{b_1',\dots,b_n'\}$ and $\iota(a_i)=b_i$ for $i\le n$.

The required isometry $\spc{U}\leftrightarrow \spc{U}'$ will be denoted by $u \leftrightarrow u'$.
Set $a'_i=b'_i$ is $i\le n$.

Let us define recursively $a_{n+1}',b_{n+1}, a_{n+2}', b_{n+2},\dots$ --- on the odd step we define the images of $a_{n+1},a_{n+2},\dots$ and on the even steps we define inverse images of $b'_{n+1},b'_{n+2},\dots$.
The same argument as in the proof of \ref{prop:sep-in-urys} shows that we can construct two sequences $a_1',a_2',\dots\in \spc{U}'$ and $b_1,b_2,\dots\in \spc{U}$ such that
\begin{align*}
\dist{a_i}{a_j}{\spc{U}}&=\dist{a_i'}{a_j'}{\spc{U}'}
\\
\dist{a_i}{b_j}{\spc{U}}&=\dist{a_i'}{b_j'}{\spc{U}'}
\\
\dist{b_i}{b_j}{\spc{U}}&=\dist{b_i'}{b_j'}{\spc{U}'}
\end{align*}
for all $i$ and $j$.

It remains to observe that the constructed distance-preserving bijection defined by $a_i\leftrightarrow a_i'$ and $b_i\leftrightarrow b_i'$ extends
continuously to an isometry $\spc{U}\leftrightarrow \spc{U}'$. 
\qeds

Observe that \ref{thm:urysohn-unique} implies that the Urysohn space (as well as the $d$-Urysohn space) is \index{homogeneous}\emph{finite-set homogeneous}; that is,
\begin{itemize}
 \item any distance-preserving map from a finite subset to the whole space can be extended to an isometry.
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}{Open question}
Is there a {}\emph{noncomplete} finite-set homogeneous metric space that meets the extension property?
\end{thm}

This is question of Pavel Urysohn; it appeared already in \cite[\S2(6)]{urysohn} and reappeared in \cite[p. 83]{gromov-2007} with a missing key word.
In fact I do not see an example of a 1-point homogeneous  space with extension property.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sphere-in-urysohn}
Let $S_r(p)$ be a sphere of radius $r$ centered at $p$ in the $d$-Urysohn space $\spc{U}_d$;
that is, 
\[S_r(p)=\set{x\in \spc{U}_d}{\dist{p}{x}{\spc{U}_d}=r}.\]
Show that $S_r(p)$ is isometric to $\spc{U}_d$ if $d\ge r\ge \tfrac d2$.

Use it to show that $\spc{U}_d$ is not countable-set homogeneous;
that is, there is a distance-preserving map from a countable subset of $\spc{U}_d$ to $\spc{U}_d$ that cannot be extended to an isometry of $\spc{U}_d$.
\end{thm}

In fact the Urysohn space is compact-set homogeneous; more precisely the following theorem holds.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:compact-homogeneous}
Let $K$ be a compact set in an ($d$-)Urysohn space $\spc{U}$.
Then any distance-preserving map $K\to \spc{U}$ can be extended to an isometry of $\spc{U}$.
\end{thm}

A proof can be obtained by modifying the proofs of \ref{prop:completion-univeral} and \ref{thm:urysohn-unique}
the same way as it is done in \ref{ex:compact-extension}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise} Which of the following metric spaces
\begin{subthm}{}
Euclidean plane,
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
 Hilbert space $\ell^2$,
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
 $\ell^\infty$,
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
 $\ell^1$
\end{subthm}
are 
1-point set homogenius, finite set homogenius, compact set homogenius, countable homogeneous?
\end{thm}


\section{Remarks}

The statement in \ref{ex:frechet} was proved by Maurice René Fréchet in the paper where he defined metric space \cite{frechet};
its extension \ref{lem:kuratowski} was given by Kazimierz Kuratowski~\cite{kuratowski}.
The question about existence of a separable universal space was posted by Maurice René Fréchet and answered by
Pavel Urysohn~\cite{urysohn}.

The idea of Urysohn's construction was reused in graph theory; it produces the so called {}\emph{Rado graph},
also known as {}\emph{Erd\H{o}s–R\'enyi graph} or \emph{random graph}; a good survey on the subject is given by Peter Cameron~\cite{cameron}.
