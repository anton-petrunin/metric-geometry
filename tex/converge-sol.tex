Denote by $X_r$ the $r$ neighborhood of a set $X\z\subset \RR^2$.
Observe  that 
\[(\Conv X)_r=\Conv(X_r),\]
and try to use it.

The answer is ``no'' in both parts.

For the first part let $X$ be a unit disc and $Y$ a finite $\eps$-net in $X$.
Evidently $|X-Y|_{\Haus\RR^2}<\eps$, 
but
$|\partial X-\partial Y|_{\Haus\RR^2}\approx 1$.

For the second part take $X$ to be a unit disc and $Y=\partial X$ to be its boundary circle.
Note that $\partial X=\partial Y$ in particular $\dist{\partial X}{\partial Y}{\Haus\RR^2}=0$ while $\dist{ X}{ Y}{\Haus\RR^2}=1$.

\parit{Remark.}
A more interesting example for the second part can be build on {}\emph{lakes of Wada} --- and example of three open bounded topological disks in the plane that have identical boundary.

\parbf{\ref{ex:Huas-perimeter-area}.}
Let $A$ be a compact convex set in the plane.
Denote by $A^r$ the closed $r$-neighborhood of $A$.
Recall that by Steiner's formula we have
\[\area A^r=\area A+r\cdot\perim A+\pi\cdot r^2.\]
Taking derivative and applying coarea formula, we get 
\[\perim A^r=\perim A+2\cdot\pi\cdot r.\]

Observe that if $A$ lies in a compact set $B$ bounded by a closed curve, then 
\[\perim A\le \perim B.\]
Indeed the closest-point projection $\RR^2\to A$ is short and it maps $\partial B$ onto $\partial A$.

It remains to observe that if $A_n\to A_\infty$, then for any $r>0$ we have that
\[A_\infty^r\supset A_n
\quad\text{and}\quad
A_\infty\subset A_n^r\]
for all large $n$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:GH-inj}.}
Let $\spc{U}$ be as in \ref{prop:GH=X+Y}.
Suppose that $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\spc{U}}<\eps$;
we need to show that 
\[|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\GH}<2\cdot \eps.\]

Denote by $\hat{\spc{U}}$ the injective envelop of $\spc{U}$.
Recall that $\spc{U}$, $\spc{X}$, and $\spc{Y}$ can be considered as subspaces of $\hat{\spc{U}}$, $\hat{\spc{X}}$, and $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ respectively.

According to \ref{ex:d-p-inclusion}, the inclusions $\spc{X}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$ and $\spc{Y}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$ can be extended to distance preserving inclusions $\hat{\spc{X}}\hookrightarrow\hat{\spc{U}}$ and $\hat{\spc{Y}}\hookrightarrow\hat{\spc{U}}$.
Therefore we can and will consider  $\hat{\spc{X}}$ and $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ as subspaces of $\hat{\spc{U}}$.


Given $f\in \hat{\spc{U}}$,
let us find $g\in \hat{\spc{X}}$ such that 
\[|f(u)-g(u)|<2\cdot\eps\eqlbl{|g-f|}\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
Note that the restriction $f|_{\spc{X}}$ is admissible on ${\spc{X}}$.
By \ref{obs:extremal:below}, there is $g\in \hat{\spc{X}}$ such that 
\[g(x)\le f(x)\eqlbl{g(x)=<f(x)}\]
for any $x\in\spc{X}$.


Recall that any extremal function is $1$-Lipschitz;
in particular $f$ and $g$ are $1$-Lipschitz on $\spc{U}$.
Therefore \ref{g(x)=<f(x)} and $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\spc{U}}<\eps$ imply that
\[g(u)< f(u)+2\cdot \eps\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
By \ref{ex:+-c}, we also have 
\[g(u)> f(u)-2\cdot \eps\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
Whence \ref{|g-f|} follows.

It follows that $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ lies in a $2\cdot\eps$-neighborhood of $\hat{\spc{X}}$ in $\hat{\spc{U}}$.
The same way we show that $\hat{\spc{X}}$ lies in a $2\cdot\eps$-neighborhood of $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ in $\hat{\spc{U}}$.
The later means that
$|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\Haus\spc{U}}<2\cdot\eps$,
and therefore
$|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\GH}<2\cdot\eps$.

\parit{Comment.} 
This problem was discussed by Urs Lang, Maël Pavón, and Roger Züst \cite[3.1]{lang-pavon-zust}.

They also show that the constant 2 is optimal.
To see this look at the injective envelops of two 4-point metric spaces shown on the diagram and observe that the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between the 4-point metric spaces is 1, while the distance between their injective envelops approaches 2 as $s\to\infty$. 




\parbf{\ref{ex:GH-po:a}.}
In order to check that $\dist{*}{*}{\GH'}$ is a metric, it is sufficient to show that
\[\dist{\spc{X}}{\spc{Y}}{\GH'}=0 
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\spc{X}\iso\spc{Y};\]
the remaining conditions are trivial.

If $\dist{\spc{X}}{\spc{Y}}{\GH'}=0$, then there is a sequence of maps $f_n\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ such that 
\[\dist{f_n(x)}{f_n(x')}{\spc{Y}}\ge \dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}-\tfrac1n.\]

Choose a countable dense set $S$ in $\spc{X}$.
Passing to a subsequence of $f_n$ we can assume that $f_n(x)$ converges for any $x\in S$ as $n\to\infty$;
denote its limit by $f_\infty(x)$.

For each point $x\in\spc{X}$ choose a sequence $x_m\in S$ converging to $x$.
Since $\spc{Y}$ is compact, we can assume in addition that $y_m=f_\infty(x_m)$ converges in $\spc{Y}$.
Set $f_\infty(x)=y$.
Note that the map $f_\infty\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ is  distance-nondecreasing.

The same way we can construct a distance-nondecreasing map 
$g_\infty\:\spc{Y}\to \spc{X}$.

By \ref{ex:non-contracting-map}, the compositions $f_\infty\circ g_\infty\:\spc{Y}\to \spc{Y}$ and $g_\infty\z\circ f_\infty\:\spc{X}\to \spc{X}$ are isometries.
Therefore $f_\infty$ and $g_\infty$ are isometries as well.

%Observe that 
%$$|\spc{X}_n-\spc{X}_\infty|_{\mathcal{M}}\to 0 
%\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 
%\dist{\spc{X}_n}{\spc{X}_\infty}{\GH'}\to 0$$
%follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:GH-e-isom} and Exercise~\ref{ex:alm-isom:inverse}.
%To prove that 
%$$|\spc{X}_n-\spc{X}_\infty|_{\mathcal{M}}\to 0 
%\quad\Longleftarrow\quad 
%\dist{\spc{X}_n}{\spc{X}_\infty}{\GH'}\to 0,$$
%Suppose that $f_n\:\spc{X}_n\to\spc{X}_\infty$ and $g_n\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\spc{X}_n$ are $\eps_n$-almost distance-nondecreasing maps for $\eps_n\to 0$.
%Arguing as above, pass to a partial limit $h$ of the sequence $f_n\circ g_n\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\spc{X}_\infty$.
%Note that $h$ is a distance non-deceasing map from a compact space to an itself.
%By Exercise~\ref{ex:non-contracting-map}, $h$ is an isometry.


\parbf{\ref{pr:doubling}.}
Choose a space $\spc{X}$ in $\spc{Q}(C,D)$, denote a $C$-doubling measure by $\mu$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $\mu(\spc{X})\z=1$.

The doubling condition implies that 
\[\mu[\oBall(p,\tfrac D{2^n})]\ge\tfrac 1{C^n}\]
for any point $x\in \spc{X}$.
It follows that 
\[\pack_{\frac D{2^n}}\spc{X}\le C^n.\]

By \ref{ex:pack-net}, for any $\eps\ge\frac D{2^{n-1}}$, the space $\spc{X}$ admits an $\eps$-net with at most $C^n$ points.
Whence $\spc{Q}(C,D)$ is uniformly totally bounded.

\parbf{\ref{pr:under}.} 
Since $\spc{Y}$ is compact, it has a finite $\eps$-net for any $\eps>0$.
For each $\eps>0$ choose a finite $\eps$-net $\{y_1,\dots,y_{n_\eps}\}$ in $\spc{Y}$.

Suppose $f\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ be a distance-nondecreasing map.
Choose one point $x_i$ in each nonempty subset $B_i=f^{-1}[\oBall(y_i,\eps)]$.
Note that the subset $B_i$ has diameter at most $2\cdot \eps$ and 
\[\spc{X}=\bigcup_iB_i.\]
Therefore the set of points $\{x_i\}$ forms a $2\cdot\eps$ net in $\spc{X}$.
Whence \ref{SHORT.pr:under:if} follows.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.pr:under:only-if}.} Let $\spc{Q}$ be a uniformly totally bounded family of spaces. 
Suppose that each space in $\spc{Q}$ has an $\tfrac1{2^n}$-net with at most $M_n$ points; we may assume that $M_0=1$.

Consider the space $\spc{Y}$ of all infinite integer sequences $m_0,m_1,\dots$ such that $1\le m_n\le M_n$ for any $n$.
Given two sequences $(\ell_n)$, and $(m_n)$ of points in $\spc{Y}$, set 
\[\dist{(\ell_n)}{(m_n)}{\spc{Y}}=\tfrac C{2^{n}},\]
where $n$ is minimal index such that $\ell_n\ne m_n$ and $C$ is a positive constant.

Observe that $\spc{Y}$ is compact.
Indeed it is complete and the sequences constant starting from index $n$ form a finite $\tfrac C{2^{n}}$-net in $\spc{Y}$.

Given a space $\spc{X}$ in $\spc{Q}$,
choose a sequence of $\tfrac1{2^n}$ nets 
$N_n\subset\spc{X}$ for each natural $n$.
We can assume that $|N_n|\le M_n$; let us enumerate the points in $N_n$ by $\{1,\dots,M_n\}$.
Consider the map $f:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ defined by $f:x\to (m_1(x),m_2(x),\dots)$ where $m_n(x)$ is a number of the point in $N_n$ that lies on the distance $<\tfrac1{2^n}$ from $x$.

If $\tfrac1{2^{n-2}}\ge \dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}>\tfrac1{2^{n-1}}$, then $m_n(x)\ne m_n(x')$.
It follows that $\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}\ge \tfrac C{2^{n}}$.
In particular, if $C>10$, then 
\[\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}\ge \dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}\]
for any $x,x'\in \spc{X}$.
That is, $f$ is a distance-nondecreasing map $\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:GH-SC},} \ref{SHORT.ex:GH-SC:circle}.
Suppose $\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}$ and $\spc{X}_n$ are simply connected length metric space.
It is sufficient to show that any nontrivial covering map $f\:\tilde{\spc{X}}\to \spc{X}$ corresponds to a nontrivial covering map $f_n\:\tilde{\spc{X}}_n\to \spc{X}_n$ for large $n$.

The latter can be constructed by covering $\spc{X}_n$ by small balls that lie close to sets in $\spc{X}$ evenly covered by $f$, prepare few copies of these sets and glue them the same way as the inverse images of the evenly covered sets in $\spc{X}$ glued to obtain $\tilde{\spc{X}}$.

Let $\spc{V}$ be a cone over Hawaiian earring.
Consider the {}\emph{doubled cone} $\spc{W}$ --- two copies of $\spc{V}$ with glued base points earrings (see the diagram).

The space $\spc{W}$ can be equipped with length metric for example the induced length metric from the shown embedding.

Note that $\spc{V}$ is simply connected, but $\spc{W}$ is not --- it is a good exercise in topology.

If we delete from the earrings all small circles, then the obtained double cone becomes simply connected and it remains to be close to $\spc{W}$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.

\parit{Remark.}
Note that from part \ref{SHORT.ex:GH-SC:nonsc-limit}, the limit does not admit a nontrivial covering.
So if we define fundamental group right --- as the inverse image of groups of deck transformations for all its coverings, then one may say that Gromov--Hausdorff limit of simply connected length spaces is simply connected.

\parbf{\ref{ex:sphere-to-ball},}
\textit{\ref{SHORT.ex:sphere-to-ball:2}.}
Suppose that a metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is close to the disc $\DD^2$.
Note that $\mathbb{S}^2$ contains a circle $\gamma$ that is close to the boundary curve of $\DD^2$.
By Jordan curve theorem, $\gamma$ divides $\mathbb{S}^2$ into two discs, say $D_1$ and $D_2$.

By \ref{ex:GH-SC:nonsc-limit}, the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of $D_1$ and $D_2$ have to contain whole $\DD^2$, otherwise the limit would admit a nontrivial covering.
Consider points $p_1\in D_1$ and $p_2\in D_2$ that a close to the center of $\DD^2$.
On one hand the distance $\dist{p_1}{p_2}{n}$ have to be very small.
On the other hand, any curve from $p_1$ to $p_2$ must cross $\gamma$, so it has length about 2 at least --- a contradiction.



\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:sphere-to-ball:3}.}
Make fine burrows in the standard 3-ball without changing its topology,
but at the same time come sufficiently close to any point in the ball.

Consider the \index{doubling}\emph{doubling} of the obtained ball along its boundary;
that is, two copies of the ball with identified corresponding points on their boundaries.
The obtained space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$.
Note that the burrows can be made 
so that the obtained space is sufficiently close to the original ball 
in the Gromov--Hausdorff metric.
