Observe that there are points $b,b'\in B$ such that 
$\dist{a}{b}{\spc{X}},\dist{a'}{b'}{\spc{X}}<r$.
Whence 
\[\dist{a}{a'}{\spc{X}}-\dist{b}{b'}{\spc{X}}\le 2\cdot r\]

The answer is ``no'' in both parts.

For the first part let $A$ be a unit disk and $B$ a finite $\eps$-net in $A$.
Evidently, $|A-B|_{\Haus\RR^2}<\eps$, 
but
$|\partial A-\partial B|_{\Haus\RR^2}\approx 1$.

For the second part take $A$ to be a unit disk and $B=\partial A$ to be its boundary circle.
Note that $\partial A=\partial B$; in particular, $\dist{\partial A}{\partial B}{\Haus\RR^2}=0$ while $\dist{ A}{B}{\Haus\RR^2}=1$.

For each pair $a_i,b_j$ construct a constant-speed path $\gamma_{i,j}$ from $a_i$ to $b_j$ such that

Set 
\[C(t)=\set{\gamma_{i,j}(t)}{\dist{a_i}{b_j}{\spc{X}}<r+\eps}.\]
Observe that $C(t)$ is finite; in particular, it is compact.

\dist{A}{C(t)}{\spc{X}}&<t\cdot r+10\cdot\eps,

Choose points $p,q\in\spc{X}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:Huas-perimeter-area}.}
Let $A$ be a compact convex set in the plane.
Denote by $A^r$ the closed $r$-neighborhood of $A$.
Recall that by Steiner's formula we have
\[\area A^r=\area A+r\cdot\perim A+\pi\cdot r^2.\]
Taking derivative and applying the coarea formula, we get 
\[\perim A^r=\perim A+2\cdot\pi\cdot r.\]

Observe that if $A$ lies in a compact set $B$ bounded by a closed curve, then 
\[\perim A\le \perim B.\]
Indeed the closest-point projection $\RR^2\to A$ is short and it maps $\partial B$ onto $\partial A$.

It remains to use the following observation: if $A_n\to A_\infty$, then for any $r>0$ we have that
\[A_\infty^r\supset A_n
\quad\text{and}\quad
A_\infty\subset A_n^r\]
for all large $n$.

In particular, for almost all pairs of points $a,b\z\in\partial D$ the two angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ between the chord $[ab]$ and $ \partial D$ are defined.

The convexity of $D'$ implies that $\alpha=\beta$;
here we measure the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on one side from $[ab]$.
Show that if the identity $\alpha=\beta$ holds for almost all chords, then $D$ is a round disk.

Therefore, passing to a subsequence, we may assume that the sequence $\distfun_{A_n}$ converges to some function $f$.

for large $r$; see the definition of Gromov--Hausdorff metric (\ref{def:GH}).

Set $n=\lceil r \rceil$.
Note that there are $2\cdot n$ integer points in~$\spc{A}_r$: 
$a_1\z=(0,0)$, $a_2=(1,0),\dots,a_{2\cdot n}=(n,1)$.
Choose a point $b_i\in \spc{B}_r$ that lies at the minimal distance from $a_i$.
Note that $|b_i-b_j|>\tfrac 45$ if $i\ne j$.
It follows that $r>\tfrac 45\cdot (2\cdot n-1)$.
The latter contradicts $n=\lceil r \rceil$ for large~$r$.

Suppose that $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\spc{U}}<\eps$;
we need to show that 
\[|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\GH}<2\cdot \eps.\]

Denote by $\hat{\spc{U}}$ the injective envelope of $\spc{U}$.
Recall that $\spc{U}$, $\spc{X}$, and $\spc{Y}$ can be considered as subspaces of $\hat{\spc{U}}$, $\hat{\spc{X}}$, and $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ respectively.

According to \ref{ex:d-p-inclusion}, the inclusions $\spc{X}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$ and $\spc{Y}\hookrightarrow\spc{U}$ can be extended to a distance-preserving inclusions $\hat{\spc{X}}\hookrightarrow\hat{\spc{U}}$ and $\hat{\spc{Y}}\hookrightarrow\hat{\spc{U}}$.
Therefore, we can and will consider  $\hat{\spc{X}}$ and $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ as subspaces of $\hat{\spc{U}}$.

Given $f\in \hat{\spc{U}}$,
let us find $g\in \hat{\spc{X}}$ such that 
\[|f(u)-g(u)|<2\cdot\eps\eqlbl{|g-f|}\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
Note that the restriction $f|_{\spc{X}}$ is admissible on ${\spc{X}}$.
By \ref{obs:extremal:below}, there is $g\in \hat{\spc{X}}$ such that 
\[g(x)\le f(x)\eqlbl{g(x)=<f(x)}\]
for any $x\in\spc{X}$.

Recall that any extremal function is $1$-Lipschitz;
in particular, $f$ and $g$ are $1$-Lipschitz on $\spc{U}$.
Therefore, \ref{g(x)=<f(x)} and $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\spc{U}}<\eps$ imply that
\[g(u)< f(u)+2\cdot \eps\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
By \ref{ex:+-c}, we also have 
\[g(u)> f(u)-2\cdot \eps\]
for any $u\in\spc{U}$.
Whence \ref{|g-f|} follows.

It follows that $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ lies in a $2\cdot\eps$-neighborhood of $\hat{\spc{X}}$ in $\hat{\spc{U}}$.
The same way we show that $\hat{\spc{X}}$ lies in a $2\cdot\eps$-neighborhood of $\hat{\spc{Y}}$ in $\hat{\spc{U}}$.
The latter means that
$|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\Haus\hat{\spc{U}}}<2\cdot\eps$,
and therefore
$|\hat{\spc{X}}-\hat{\spc{Y}}|_{\GH}<2\cdot\eps$.

It is sufficient to show that any nontrivial covering map $f\:\tilde{\spc{X}}\to \spc{X}$ corresponds to a nontrivial covering map $f_n\:\tilde{\spc{X}}_n\to \spc{X}_n$ for large $n$.

The latter can be constructed by covering $\spc{X}_n$ by small balls that lie close to sets in $\spc{X}$ evenly covered by $f$, prepare a few copies of these sets and glue them the same way as the inverse images of the evenly covered sets in $\spc{X}$ glued to obtain $\tilde{\spc{X}}$.

Let $\spc{V}$ be a cone over Hawaiian earrings.
Consider the {}\emph{doubled cone} $\spc{W}$ --- two copies of $\spc{V}$ with glued their base points (see the diagram).

The space $\spc{W}$ can be equipped with a length metric
(for example, the induced length metric from the shown embedding).

Show that $\spc{V}$ is simply connected, but $\spc{W}$ is not; the latter is a good exercise in topology.

If we delete from the earrings all small circles, then the obtained double cone becomes simply connected and it remains to be close to $\spc{W}$.
That is $\spc{W}$ is a Gromov--Hausdorff limit of simply connected spaces.

\parit{Remark.}
Note that from part \ref{SHORT.ex:GH-SC:nonsc-limit}, the limit does not admit a nontrivial covering.
So, if we define the fundamental group as the inverse image of groups of deck transformations for all the coverings of the given space, then one may say that Gromov--Hausdorff limit of simply connected length spaces is simply connected.

Suppose that a metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is close to the disk $\DD^2$.
Note that $\mathbb{S}^2$ contains a circle $\gamma$ that is close to the boundary curve of $\DD^2$.
By the Jordan curve theorem, $\gamma$ divides $\mathbb{S}^2$ into two disks, say $D_1$ and $D_2$.

By \ref{ex:GH-SC:circle}, the Gromov--Hausdorff limits of $D_1$ and $D_2$ have to contain the whole $\DD^2$, otherwise the limit would admit a nontrivial covering.

Consider points $p_1\in D_1$ and $p_2\in D_2$ that are close to the center of $\DD^2$.
If $n$ is large, the distance $\dist{p_1}{p_2}{n}$ has to be very small.
On the other hand, any curve from $p_1$ to $p_2$ must cross $\gamma$, so it has length about 2 --- a contradiction.

Choose a space $\spc{X}$ in $\spc{Q}(C,D)$, denote a $C$-doubling measure by~$\mu$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\mu(\spc{X})\z=1$.

The doubling condition implies that 
\[\mu[\oBall(p,\tfrac D{2^n})]\ge\tfrac 1{C^n}\]
for any point $x\in \spc{X}$.
It follows that 
\[\pack_{\frac D{2^n}}\spc{X}\le C^n.\]

By \ref{ex:pack-net}, for any $\eps\ge\frac D{2^{n-1}}$, the space $\spc{X}$ admits an $\eps$-net with at most $C^n$ points.
Whence $\spc{Q}(C,D)$ is uniformly totally bounded.

\parbf{\ref{pr:under}}; \ref{SHORT.pr:under:if}.
Choose $\eps>0$.
Since $\spc{Y}$ is compact, we can choose a finite $\eps$-net $\{y_1,\dots,y_{n}\}$ in $\spc{Y}$.

Suppose $f\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ be a distance-nondecreasing map.
Choose one point $x_i$ in each nonempty subset $B_i=f^{-1}[\oBall(y_i,\eps)]$.
Note that the subset $B_i$ has diameter at most $2\cdot \eps$ and 
\[\spc{X}=\bigcup_iB_i.\]
Therefore, the set of points $\{x_i\}$ is a $2\cdot\eps$-net in $\spc{X}$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.pr:under:only-if}.} Let $\spc{Q}$ be a uniformly totally bounded family of spaces. 
Suppose that each space in $\spc{Q}$ has an $\tfrac1{2^n}$-net with at most $M_n$ points; we may assume that $M_0=1$.

Consider the space $\spc{Y}$ of all infinite integer sequences $m_0,m_1,\dots$ such that $1\le m_n\le M_n$ for any $n$.
Given two sequences $(\ell_n)$, and $(m_n)$ of points in $\spc{Y}$, set 
\[\dist{(\ell_n)}{(m_n)}{\spc{Y}}=\tfrac C{2^{n}},\]
where $n$ is the minimal index such that $\ell_n\ne m_n$ and $C$ is a positive constant.

Observe that $\spc{Y}$ is compact.
Indeed it is complete and the sequences with constant tails, starting from index $n$, form a finite $\tfrac C{2^{n}}$-net in $\spc{Y}$.

Given a space $\spc{X}$ in $\spc{Q}$,
choose a sequence of $\tfrac1{2^n}$ nets 
$N_n\subset\spc{X}$ for each $n$.
We can assume that $|N_n|\le M_n$; let us label the points in $N_n$ by $\{1,\dots,M_n\}$.
Consider the map $f:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ defined by $f:x\to (m_1(x),m_2(x),\dots)$ where $m_n(x)$ is the label of a point in $N_n$ that lies on the distance $<\tfrac1{2^n}$ from $x$.

If $\tfrac1{2^{n-2}}\ge \dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}>\tfrac1{2^{n-1}}$, then $m_n(x)\ne m_n(x')$.
It follows that $\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}\ge \tfrac C{2^{n}}$.
In particular, if $C>10$, then 
\[\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}\ge \dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}\]
for any $x,x'\in \spc{X}$.
That is, $f$ is a distance-nondecreasing map $\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$.

Arguing the same way as in the proof of the ``only if''-part in \ref{GH-2} (page~\pageref{page:GH-2-proof}),
we get a distance-nondecreasing map $f_\infty\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$.

The same way we can construct a distance-nondecreasing map 
$g_\infty\:\spc{Y}\to \spc{X}$.

By \ref{ex:non-contracting-map}, the compositions $f_\infty\circ g_\infty\:\spc{Y}\to \spc{Y}$ and $g_\infty\z\circ f_\infty\:\spc{X}\to \spc{X}$ are isometries.
Therefore, $f_\infty$ and $g_\infty$ are isometries as well.

Show that $\{\spc{X}_n\}$ is a uniformly totally bonded family.

If $\dist{\spc{X}_n}{\spc{X}_\infty}{\GH}\not\to 0$, then we can pass to a subsequence such that $\dist{\spc{X}_n}{\spc{X}_\infty}{\GH}\ge\eps$ for some $\eps>0$.
By Gromov selection theorem, we can assume that $\spc{X}_n$ converges in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.
