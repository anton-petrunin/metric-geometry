\title{Metric geometry on manifolds:
\\ two lectures}
\author{Anton Petrunin}
\date{}
\maketitle

We discuss Besikovitch inequality, width, and systole of manifolds.

We assume that students familiar with the smooth manifolds, degree of map, CW-complexes and related notions.

These are two final lectures of a graduate course given at Penn State, Spring 2020.
The complete lectures can be found on the authors website;
it includes an introduction to metric geometry \cite{petrunin2020pure}
and elements of Alexandrov geometry based on \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019}.
