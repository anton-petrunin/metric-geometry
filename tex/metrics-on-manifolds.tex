\title{Metric geometry on manifolds:
\\ two lectures}
\author{Anton Petrunin}
\date{}
\maketitle

We discuss Besicovitch inequality, width, and systole of manifolds.
I assume that students are familiar with 
measure theory,
smooth manifolds,
degree of map, 
CW-complexes and related notions.

This is a polished version of two final lectures of a graduate course given at Penn State, Spring 2020.
The complete lectures can be found on the author's website;
it includes an introduction to metric geometry \cite{petrunin2020pure}
and elements of Alexandrov geometry based on \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019}.

\parbf{Acknowledgments.}
I want to thank Alexander Lytchak and Alexander Nabutovsky for help.
