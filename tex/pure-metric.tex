\maketitle


After reviewing basic definitions in metric geometry we discuss 
Uryson's \emph{universal space},
\emph{injective spaces} that are metric analogs of convex sets,
an \emph{ultralimits} of metric spaces that provides a very general way to pass to a limit without any assumptions on the sequence of spaces.
These topics are simple, usefull, and conceptual,
but they are not included in the (today the only) textbook in metric geometry written by Dmitry Burago, Yuri Burago, and Sergey Ivanov \cite{burago-burago-ivanov}.

These a lectures are taken from a graduate course given at Penn State, Spring 2020.
The complete lecture notes (14 lectures) can be found on the authors website.
Considerable part of the text is a compilation from \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019, alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2025, petrunin-yashinski, petrunin-2009, petrunin-zamorabarrera} and its drafts.
