introductory lectures}

\maketitle

We discuss only domestic affairs of metric spaces;
applications are given only as illustrations.

These notes could be used as an introductory part to virtually any course in metric geometry.
It is based on a part of the course in metric geometry given at Penn State, Spring 2020.
The complete lectures can be found on the author's website;
it includes an introduction to Alexandrov geometry based on \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019} and metric geometry on manifolds \cite{petrunin2020} based on a simplified proof of Gromov's systolic inequality given by Alexander Nabutovsky~\cite{nabutovsky}.

A part of the text is a compilation from \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019, alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2025, petrunin-yashinski, petrunin-2009, petrunin-zamorabarrera} and its drafts.

I want to thank Alexander Lytchak and Sergio Zamora Barrera for help.
