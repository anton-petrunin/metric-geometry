\parbf{\ref{ex:+-c}.}
Note that if $c<0$, then $r>s$.
The latter is impossible since $r$ is extremal and $s$ is admissible.

Observe that the function $\bar r=\min\{\,r,s+c\,\}$ is admissible.
Indeed, choose $x,y\in \spc{X}$.
If $\bar r(x)=r(x)$ and $\bar r(y)=r(y)$, then 
\[\bar r(x)+\bar r(y)=r(x)+ r(y)\ge \dist{x}{y}{}.\]
Further if $\bar r(x)=s(x)+c$, then 
\begin{align*}
\bar r(x)+\bar r(y)&\ge [s(x)+c]+ [s(y)-c]= 
\\
&=s(x)+s(y) \ge 
\\
&\ge\dist{x}{y}{}.
\end{align*}

Since $r$ is extremal, we have $r=\bar r$;
that is, $r\le s+c$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible}.}
Choose an injective space $\spc{Y}$.

\textit{\ref{SHORT.ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible:complete}.}
Fix a Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$ in $\spc{Y}$;
we need to show that it has a limit $x_\infty\in \spc{Y}$.
Consider metric on $\spc{X}=\NN\cup\{\infty\}$ defined by 
\begin{align*}
\dist{m}{n}{\spc{X}}&\df\dist{x_m}{x_n}{\spc{Y}},
\\
\dist{m}{\infty}{\spc{X}}&\df\lim_{n\to\infty}\dist{x_m}{x_n}{\spc{Y}}.
\end{align*}
Since the sequence is Cauchy, so is the sequence $\ell_n=\dist{x_m}{x_n}{\spc{Y}}$ for any $m$.
Therefore, the last limit is defined.

By construction the map $n\mapsto x_n$ is distance-preserving on $\NN\subset \spc{X}$.
Since $\spc{Y}$ is injective, this map can be extended to $\infty$ as a short map; set $\infty\mapsto x_\infty$.
Since $\dist{x_n}{x_\infty}{\spc{Y}}\le \dist{n}{\infty}{\spc{X}}$ 
and $\dist{n}{\infty}{\spc{X}}\to 0$, we get that
$x_n\to x_\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.

\textit{\ref{SHORT.ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible:geodesic}.}
Applying the definition of injective space, we get a midpoint for any pair of points in $\spc{Y}$.
By \ref{SHORT.ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible:complete},
$\spc{Y}$ is a complete space.
It remains to apply \ref{lem:mid>geod:geod}.

\textit{\ref{SHORT.ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible:contractible}.}
Let $k\:\spc{Y}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty(\spc{Y})$ be the Kuratowski embedding (\ref{lem:kuratowski}).
Observe that $\ell^\infty(\spc{Y})$ is contractible;
in particular, there is a homotopy $k_t\:\spc{Y}\hookrightarrow \ell^\infty(\spc{Y})$ such that $k_0=k$ and $k_1$ is a constant map.
(In fact one can take $k_t=(1-t)\cdot k$.)

Since $k$ is distance-preserving and $\spc{Y}$ is injective,
there is a short map $f\:\ell^\infty(\spc{Y})\to \spc{Y}$ such that the composition $f\circ k$ is the identity map on $\spc{Y}$.
The composition $f\circ k_t\:\spc{Y}\hookrightarrow \spc{Y}$ is a needed homotopy. 

\parbf{\ref{ex:injective-spaces}.}
Suppose that a short map $f\:A\to\spc{Y}$ is defined on a subset $A$ of a metric space $\spc{X}$.
We need to construct a short extension $F$ of $f$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $A\ne\emptyset$, otherwise map whole $\spc{X}$ to a single point.
By Zorn's lemma, it is sufficient to enlarge $A$ by a single point $x\notin A$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:injective-spaces:R}.}
Suppose $\spc{Y}=\RR$.
Set 
\[F(x)=\inf\set{f(a)-\dist{a}{x}{}}{a\in A}.\] 
Observe that $F$ is short and $F(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:injective-spaces:tree}.}
Suppose  $\spc{Y}$ is a complete metric tree.
Fix points $p\in \spc{X}$ and $q\in\spc{Y}$.
Given a point $a\in A$,
let $x_a\in\cBall[f(a),\dist{a}{p}{}]$ be the point closest to $f(x)$.
Note that $x_a\in[q\,f(a)]$ and either $x_a=q$ or $x_a$ lies on distance $\dist{a}{p}{}$ from $f(a)$.

Note that the geodesics $[q\,x_a]$ are nested;
that is, for any $a,b\in A$ we have either $[q\,x_a]\subset [q\,x_b]$ or $[q\,x_b]\subset [q\,x_a]$.
Moreover, in the first case we have $\dist{x_b}{f(a)}{}\le \dist{p}{a}{}$ and in the second $\dist{x_a}{f(b)}{}\le \dist{p}{b}{}$.

It follows that the closure of the union of all geodesics $[q\,x_a]$ for $a\in\spc{A}$ is a geodesic.
Denote by $x$ its endpoint; it exists since $\spc{Y}$ is complete.
It remains to observe that $\dist{x}{f(a)}{}\le \dist{p}{a}{}$ for any $a\in\spc{A}$;
that is, one can take $f(p)=x$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:injective-spaces:ell-infty}.}
In this case $\spc{Y}=(\RR^2,\ell^\infty)$.
Note that the map $\spc{X}\to (\RR^2,\ell^\infty)$ is short if and only if both of its coordinate projections are short.
It remains to apply \ref{SHORT.ex:injective-spaces:R}.

More generally, \emph{any $\ell^\infty$-product of injective spaces is injective};
in particular, if $\spc{Y}$ and $\spc{Z}$ are injective then the product $\spc{Y}\times\spc{Z}$ equipped with the metric 
\[\dist{(y,z)}{(y',z')}{\spc{Y}\times\spc{Z}}=\max\{\,\dist{y}{y'}{\spc{Y}},\dist{z}{z'}{\spc{Z}}\,\}\]
is injective as well.


\parbf{\ref{ex:ultrametric}.}
Choose three points $x,y,z\in\spc{X}$ and set $\spc{A}=\{x,z\}$.
Let $f\:\spc{A}\z\to \spc{Y}$ be an isometry.
Then $F(y)=f(x)$ or $F(y)=f(z)$.
If  $f(y)\z=f(x)$, then
\begin{align*}
\dist{y}{z}{\spc{X}}&\ge  \dist{F(y)}{f(z)}{\spc{Y}}=
\\
 &=\dist{x}{z}{\spc{X}}.
\end{align*}
Analogously if $f(y)=f(z)$, then $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}\ge\dist{x}{z}{\spc{X}}$.
The strong triangle inequality holds in both cases.

\parbf{\ref{ex:one-point-gluing}.}
Apply \ref{thm:injective=hyperconvex:balls}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:urysohn-hyperconvex}.}
Denote by $\spc{U}_d$ the $d$-Urysohn space;
so $\spc{U}_\infty$ is the Urysohn space.

The extension property implies finite hyperconvexity.
It remains to show that $\spc{U}_d$ is not countably hyperconvex.

Suppose that $d<\infty$.
Then $\diam\spc{U}_d=d$ and moreover for any point $x\in\spc{U}_d$ there is a point $y\in\spc{U}_d$ such that $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{U}_d}=d$.
It follows that there is no point $z\in\spc{U}_d$ such that $\dist{z}{x}{\spc{U}_d}\le \tfrac d2$ for any $x\in\spc{U}_d$.
Whence $\spc{U}_d$ is not countably hyperconvex.

Use \ref{ex:sphere-in-urysohn:midpoint} to reduce the case $d=\infty$ to the case $d<\infty$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:Inj(compact)}.}
Observe and use that the functions in $\Inj\spc{X}$ are 1-Lipschitz and uniformly bounded functions.

\parbf{\ref{ex:tripod+square}}; \ref{SHORT.ex:tripod+square:tripod}.
Let $f$ be an extremal function.
Observe that at least two of the numbers $f(a)+f(b)$, $f(b)+f(c)$, and $f(c)+f(a)$ are $1$.
It follows that for some $x\in[0,\tfrac12]$, we have 
\begin{align*}
f(a)&=1\pm x,&
f(b)&=1\pm x,&
f(c)&=1\pm x,
\end{align*}
where we have one ``minus'' and two ``pluses'' in these three formulas.

Suppose that
\begin{align*}
g(a)&=1\pm y,& g(b)&=1\pm y,& g(c)&=1\pm y
\end{align*}
is another extremal function.
Then $|f-g|\z=|x-y|$ if $g$ has ``minus'' at the same place as $f$ and $|f-g|=|x+y|$ otherwise.

It follows that $\Inj\spc{X}$ is isometric to a {}\emph{tripod} --- three segments of length $\tfrac12$ glued at one end.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:tripod+square:square}.}
Assume $f$ is an extremal function.
Observe that 
$f(x)+f(y)=f(p)+f(q)=2$;
in particular, two values $a=f(x)-1$ and $b=f(p)-1$ completely describe the function $f$.
Since $f$ is extremal, we also have that 
\[(1\pm a)+(1\pm b)\ge 1\]
for all 4 choices of signs;
equivalently, 
\[|a|+|b|\le 1.\]

It follows that $\Inj\spc{X}$ is isometric to the rhombus $|a|+|b|\le 1$ in the $(a,b)$-plane with the metric induced by the $\ell^\infty$-norm.





\parbf{\ref{ex:4-on-a-line}.}
Recall that 
\[\dist{f}{g}{\Inj\spc{X}}=\sup\set{|f(x)-g(x)|}{x\in\spc{X}}\]
and 
\[\dist{f}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}=f(p)\]
for any $f,g\in \Inj\spc{X}$ and $p\in \spc{X}$.

Since $\spc{X}$ is compact we can find a point $p\in\spc{X}$ such that 
\[\dist{f}{g}{\Inj\spc{X}}=|f(p)-g(p)|=\left|\dist{f}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}-\dist{g}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}\right|.\]
Without loss of generality we may assume that 
\[\dist{f}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}
=
\dist{g}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}
+
\dist{f}{g}{\Inj\spc{X}}.\]
Applying \ref{lem:opposite}, we can find a point $q\in\spc{X}$ such that 
\[\dist{q}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}
=
\dist{f}{p}{\Inj\spc{X}}
+
\dist{f}{q}{\Inj\spc{X}},\]
whence the result.

Since $\Inj\spc{X}$ is injective (\ref{prop:InjX-is-injective}), by \ref{ex:inj=complete-geodesic-contractible:geodesic} it has to be geodesic. It remains to note that the concatenation of geodesics $[pq]$, $[gf]$, and $[fq]$ is a required geodesic $[pq]$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:d-p-inclusion}.}
Show that there is a pair of short maps 
$\Inj\spc{X}\to\Inj\spc{U}\to\Inj\spc{X}$ 
such that their composition is identity of $\spc{X}$.
Make a conclusion.
